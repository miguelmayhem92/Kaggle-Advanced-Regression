# brief description 
The challenge's goal is to predict house prices (regression) based on hose features deal data. The data has many features and mainly categorical variables. 

### My strategy:
* Data exploration
* Data cleaning
* Feature enginering - data augmentaion strategy and interaction terms generation
* Model Exploration (for now linear model exploration) - bias, robust, interaction model, non linear automation
* Tunning and cross validation
* Prediction
